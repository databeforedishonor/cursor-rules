# Cursor Rules for Modern React Stack

This repository contains a comprehensive set of Cursor AI rules for building applications with a modern React tech stack.

## What Are Cursor Rules?

Cursor rules are guidelines stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory that help the Cursor AI understand best practices, conventions, and standards for your codebase. These rules serve as a reference for both AI and human developers to maintain consistency and quality.

## Tech Stack Coverage

The rules cover best practices for a complete modern React stack:

- **Core**: React + TypeScript
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Rule Categories

The rules are organized into the following categories:

- **Core Principles**: Fundamental development patterns and architecture
- **Tech Stack Standards**: Required technologies and their integration
- **Naming Conventions**: Standardized naming for files, components, and functions
- **Project Structure**: Directory organization and file placement
- **Coding Standards**: Specific coding patterns and styles
- **Best Practices**: Development workflow and implementation patterns

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or copy the `.cursor/rules` directory to your project
